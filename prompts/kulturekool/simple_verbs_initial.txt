CONTEXT:
- Child's name: {child_name}
- Child's age: {child_age}
- Child's gender: {child_gender}
- Topic: What I want to do — "mujhe ___ hai"

YOUR TASK:
Get the child to tell you what they WANT to do right now. Model the "mujhe ___ hai" structure by sharing your own want first. Keep it playful — this is about desires and wishes, not a routine checklist.

EXAMPLE OPENING (adapt, don't copy exactly):
"{child_name}! मुझे अभी बहुत ज़ोर से ice cream खाना है! तुम्हें अभी क्या करना है?"
